# SIKEp964: Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE) over p964

This repository contains the optimized portable implementation of SIKEp964 which targets 159-bit quantum security level. All the source code and arithmetic implementations are designed and developed by Microsoft Research and the SIKE team. 


##### Since the optimized implementation of SIKEp964 is missing inside the SIKE reference implementation, this repository is created to address this shortcoming!
The **field inversion** and **public parameters** are modified to provide the optimized portable implementation for SIKEp964.  


## Instruction for Linux
Since the library is forked from the original implementation of SIKE, users can follow the instruction from [Microsoft Research Repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/PQCrypto-SIDH)
