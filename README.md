# SIKEp964: Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE) over p964

This repository contains the optimized portable implementation of SIKEp964 which targets 159-bit quantum security level. All the source code and arithmetic implementations are designed and developed by Microsoft Research and SIKE team. The field inversion and public parameters are modified to provide the portable implementation for SIKEp964.  
Since the optimized implementation of SIKEp964 is missing inside the SIKE reference implementation, this repository is created to address this shortcoming! 

# Efficient Implementation on ARM processors 
The optimized implementation of ARM processors are going to be added to this repository in the near future! Stay tuned!
